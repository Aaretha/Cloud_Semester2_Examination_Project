# Cloud_Semester2_Examination_Project
#### Purpose for this document  
Documentation of the steps taken with screenshots, including proof of the applicationâ€™s accessibility (screenshots taken where necessary)  

### STEP 1: Uderstand the project/Design a solution  
At reception of the project, I sought to understand the project. After a little study time, I realised that deploying the LAMP stack is essentiall all that's further listed in the project objectives and the neccessary php extensions were the `php libapache2-mod-php` and `php-mysql`.  
For the _readability_ requirement, I use documentation with comments and for the _reusabilty_, my guess for this is through modularization and parametarization.

### STEP 2: Implement the solution  
After understanding and walking through what needs to be done, I sought to implement the design which looked like understanding what commands fufills what requirements.  
**SCRIPT WITHOUT PARAMETERS**

After testing the implementation of the script without using parameters, I introduced parameters - variables for the configuration of the Apache server, the MySQL(database) server and the Laravel application.
**SCRIPT WITH PARAMETERS**

### STEP 3: Test implementation and reiterate through the process as necessary   

At this stage, I faced a couple of errors; especially after I had run the script a couple of times.
The first inadequacy showed up when the initial running of the playbook would not complete. I eventually cancelled it after about 26 hours. Upon investigation, I found that its the line `sudo mysql_secure_installation` that's expecting a response and I did not make provisions for that. The initial solution to this was avoidance: commenting out the line and later on, I sought for how to rectify it and found the `expect` functionality which seemed to have profered a solution to the problem at hand.
